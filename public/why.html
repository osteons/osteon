            <div class="find-out-where">
                <p>Benchmarks can give you a sense of how much it costs to build your product versus market alternatives. Sometimes, it's already apparent when checking the cost per unit function of your product e.g. $1,000 cost to provide your customer $1 of value. Sometimes it's not that apparent, especially for products with intangible value. Benchmarks help you here make a better judgment call as to whether the difference is worthwhile. <br>
                <br>
                <b>The benchmark is not a like-for-like replacement for my product!</b><br> 
                Yes, benchmarks are not intended to be fully like-for-like comparisons. However, they provide a starting point for you to assess the efficiency of your product and ensure it provides bang for your buck.<br> 
                <br>
                Benchmarks will have different performance, resilience, accuracy or security aspects from your product. Consider how important these aspects are to solving your problem, and if the delta in cost is worth it.<br>
                <br> 
                <b>My target audience is different from/smaller than the market for these benchmarks.</b><br> 
                Consider if you might be able to make your product more efficient by eliminating requirements that are unnecessary to solve your problem, or by scaling to other target audiences.<br>
                <br>
                <b>My product is still in its early stages and cannot be expected to be as efficient as these large-scale mature products!</b><br> 
                Consider using these benchmarks as a target for your product as it scales!
